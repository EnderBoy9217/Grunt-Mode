#### Gameplay:

A Battlefront 2-style class system is added to the game, allowing you to purchase and view certain classes with special abilities and drawbacks.

Movement has been decreased for most classes, disabling wallrunning and double jump for standard grunts

You will infil into the near your team in seperate ways, you can be sent in via droppod, jump off a dropship with your squad, or simply spawn on the ground

AI have increased health and will behave similar to the master difficulty (Taking cover, etc.)

Special AI have been added to the gamemode such as Titans, Prowlers, Specialists, and Shield Captains (and more), these will follow attrition escalation and more powerful units will spawn later in the round.

Enjoy this gamemode in its three main supported gamemodes, including Attrition, Pilots vs. Pilots, and Amped Hardpoints, or on other gamemodes like Bounty Hunt or Capture the Flag.

Classes will decide your looks, ability, grenade, weapons, and other features
